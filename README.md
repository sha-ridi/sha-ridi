👋 Hi, I’m Dina

👀 I’m interested in **Game Programming**

📁 Here you can find my personal projects, mostly from various courses I've completed

🌱 I’m currently part of a team developing a **Multiplayer PvE Roguelite Shooter**, focusing primarily on enemies & bosses, including:

  - 🤖 **AI**
  - 🐣 **Spawn System**
  - ✨ **Animation, SFX, VFX, etc. integration**
  - 🕹 **Game Modes**
